# Hello and Welcome!


## Personal Information

Student Number: S3788793

Email Address: ArinCasheEdwards@gmail.com

Hello! My full name is Arin Cashe Edwards. I am 21 years old and have lived in Victoria all my life. I am Australian and have always enjoyed the world of Information technology since I was very young. One interesting fact about myself is that I had long hair since I was about 5 years old and didn’t cut it until December of last year. It feels very different and not surprisingly a lot lighter and easier to maintain.

##### Here is also a recent photo of me (all the way to the right) with friends and family -

## Interest In Information Technology

#### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
I think my Interest in Information technology (I.T) would have started at a young age. I’ve always been fascinated on the way technology works and how far we’ve come in such a short time from the first computer to be built that could be the size of a room to having one right next to your desk or even having one on the go/portable I think it rather amazing. I don’t have any formal/professional I.T experience but have always enjoyed how we can implement it through our daily life.

#### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
The reason I came to RMIT was because I have always heard a high reputation about it. To me it seems like one of the best within the state, even Australia. Having a bachelor’s course into Information technology I think would be beneficial for many students including myself to show the ins and outs of it. I’ve had many of my friends/family attended RMIT and believe it has furthered them on in their study and helped them to find the career they want.

#### What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I hope to get a vast variety of different subjects to learn in which I will be able to determine what job I would want to do in the future. I would like to learn mostly anything within the field of IT but maybe learn a little bit deeper into what a security analyst does maybe even an app developer as I find these fields rather interesting. I want to learn a different range of subjects that I pick out and stick by throughout this course.

## Ideal Job (Right now)

#### A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
I find this type of job appealing as it keeps companies safe. There will also be something new going on everyday which will keep me wanting to go that extra step further. I won’t feel like I’m doing the same job everyday as new types of security will be added throughout the years and I can keep up to date with it. Being able to implement security networks while having attention to detail for certain business is something that I feel right now suits me. I feel as this role is looking for someone that has had many years of experience being a security analyst while also being able to work in a large team which is something I could work towards.

#### A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.
This type of Job would be looking for someone that has experience within the Information technology field or a computer science degree. Besides having the qualification though, you should have some experience within that kind of work place and knowledge of Victorian Protective Data Security Standards to work with like minded people and have communication skills throughout working there.

#### A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.
I currently don’t have any experience that I know of within this type of field but hope to eventually be able to get some whether it be throughout my course or eventually applying for graduate jobs after completing my studies.

#### A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.
I know there can be a few places that take trainee’s on board within little to no empierce and train them from the ground up. However, I hope to finish my course, hopefully get some experience within the field while doing it, maybe afterwards apply to some graduate courses and possibly study further in the field. Maybe go into a computer science course as well, then eventually when I have got all the skills that I feel would be required for a job such as that, apply for it.

#### What do the results of these tests mean for you?
I found the results rather interesting in some parts such as in the Myers Briggs test I came out an Entertainer (ESFP-A) which kind of mean I’m a really out there kind of person which can seem like me in some aspects but I guess it depends more so on the situation I am in. I thought it captured though how I am a little bit more likely to go with my decision rather than others but can be introverted in some way more than extraverted. I thought the learning style captured me perfectly though, I do prefer to learn hands on (Tactile 45%) as I think ‘if I do it myself as practice, get someone to check if it’s right then I can keep doing it that way’. Secondly, I got visual (30%) which wasn’t too far away from auditory (25%) which is also correct, I would rather watch someone else do it then just listen to them doing it. On the final test I did which was the big five personality test (BFPT) I found it interesting that both extravert from the Myers Briggs test and BFPT were similar. Through looking through the results from all the tests I did find it rather interesting that some would correlate into one another thinking to myself that maybe I am more extraverted or open than I originally thought I would be.

#### How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
Being more open and out there I believe that I will be able to communicate a lot more within my team. I hope I’m not too assertive within a group as I believe that everyone should have their fair say in their own decisions but hope to get like minded people in the group and lots of energy for the people I form a group with.

#### How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I think it’s crucial in a sense that you should be finding likeminded people in a group project or even when you are in a work space. This can help avoid conflict within the work space and if we are similar in some personality respects we may be more understanding of each other. If I have someone in my group that is a tactical learner, the same I as am it would be easier for me to help them and vice versa. Also, people that can bring energy and be fun in a group rather than just straight out could also benefit the team in being more energetic.

## Project Idea

#### Overview:
With the Emerging technology that has come out lately and smart phones coming out with graphics that people could only dream of years ago, I think it would be a innovative idea to make a mobile phone that doubles as a gaming console w/ a dock that can connect to a T.V also with foldable technology so it’s easy to carry around on the go. This would be an interesting idea as there have been smart phones that are gaming phones and can play desktop games like ‘player unknown battlegrounds’ or ‘Fortnite’ (or course on a lower graphical setting) but also Nintendo switch that is a portable device can play games like these in a small form factor with relatively cutting edge graphics being able to put foldable technology would be doubling two pieces of technology into one.

#### Motivation:
Always had my here and there for games and who hasn’t. smart phone technology has come a long way in the last 10 years (we practically have graphics better than PlayStation 2’s on a tiny, thin form factor; I think that is rather amazing) and wouldn’t be surprised if this idea implemented somewhere in the near future. With a lot of people using their smart phones to play some app store/play store games on the go, it would be evolutionary to see current gen games on an even more portable device plus having a dock to connect to a television so it will be just like playing on a gaming console such as a PlayStation or Xbox when at home.

#### Detailed Description:
The Product should be evolutionary, bringing together a two for one type of deal. A good place to start would be the features of this product. Using a USB type C dock would allow the device to charge at home and let the dock have a HDMI port that connects to the television. Controllers will be able to slip onto the side of the smart phone, gaming product but also easily come off to give it the sleek incognito look of being a mobile phone. This device should have a 7 to 8-inch touch screen display, but while it is also foldable, should be able to fit into your pocket, with roughly a 4 to 5-inch touch screen display on the front of the device as well. The front side of this device should more be treated at the smart phone side and when it is unfolded you get a bigger screen and with the controllers able to properly fit on the sides. Trying to limit the ports on this device due to the small form factor of it will not come with a headphone jack build inside it but instead an adapter, Bluetooth technology will mostly be used for anything that is paired eg: headphones, controller, mic. Ethernet cables will go into the devices dock, but it will also have wireless for if you wanted to play a game when you’re in the city. Using the best on the current market for CPU/GPU’s that can be bought at this time will be used inside this device, it should have anywhere between 8-12gb of ram, roughly a 4000-4500mAh lithium ion battery, a portable fan that can be put in the centre back of the device for intense current gen gaming (this way it can help limit the fans needed on the inside which will take up extra room, putting the large fans on the outside while keeping the smaller fans on the inside would allow for a larger battery, being able to put more ‘smart phone’ phone features on the inside as it is a two for one. This device will come with the ordinary smart phone features such as calling, texting, mp3 player, etc. the way it would play current gen games is with cartridges as these are smaller and easier to fit in than adding a cd/Blu-ray player it will also come with expandable storage so you don’t have to delete data off to play different games using microSD cards but will also come with different optional installed storage such as getting a 128gb model.

#### Tools and Technologies:
The type of software that could be used would be android, lots of smartphones and tablets use this kind of software and it has become more refined over the last few years, this would also benefit the smart phone side and not having to start from scratch with making it’s own software. Making this projects hardware would require a large team of engineers as it is using the latest gen technology a lot in which hasn’t been done before. Probably using custom made GPU/CPU’s to fit everything into its small form.

#### Skills Required:
-Current android software (modified)
-Custom hardware (Gpu/Cpu motherboards).
It would be extremely hard to build this from the ground up, having to make sure the android type of software would be able to recognize such things like cartridges and be able to develop current gen graphics that use a display that can fold and be used as a smart phone. This type of project would require some top tier engineers that know about the new types of technologies and having them implement custom made hardware.

#### Outcome:
If the project was successful there would be a whole lot more people gaming on the go. It would be so much easier to have one unified device then just a several different ones. If you’re ever with yours friends and want to play a game, it’s easily accessible right within your smart gaming phone. Most people take their phone everywhere they go, having a phone with a little bit extra entertainment plus a standard console when connected to your dock as home would probably increase the amount of game sales due to portability. Lots of people might take the train to work and scroll on social media, now you will be able to play a certain game you like on your daily commute.
